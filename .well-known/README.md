# Apple Pay Domain Verification

## Status: VERIFIED

The domain `thenursingcollective.pro` has been verified for Apple Pay through Stripe Dashboard.

The domain shows as "Enabled" in Stripe's Payment method domains settings, which means Apple Pay is ready to use on the production site.

## Notes

- Stripe handles the domain verification automatically in most cases
- If re-verification is ever needed, go to Stripe Dashboard > Settings > Payments > Payment method domains
- The Payment Element will automatically show Apple Pay as an option on supported devices (Safari on Mac/iOS with Apple Pay configured)
