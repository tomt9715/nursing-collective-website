# Critical Laboratory Values

Life-threatening laboratory values requiring immediate provider notification and intervention.

---

## Definition and Importance

Critical values are laboratory results that indicate a life-threatening situation requiring immediate clinical action. These values fall outside the reference range to a degree that represents imminent danger to the patient. The Joint Commission mandates that healthcare facilities establish policies for reporting critical values.

### Magnesium
- **Critical Low:** <1.0 mEq/L
- **Critical High:** >4.0 mEq/L

**Immediate Actions:**
- Monitor deep tendon reflexes
- Assess respiratory status (especially for hypermagnesemia)
- Keep calcium gluconate available as antidote
- Check concurrent potassium and calcium levels

## Glucose

### Hypoglycemia
- **Critical:** <50 mg/dL

**Immediate Actions:**
- If conscious and able to swallow: 15-20g fast-acting carbohydrate
- If altered mental status: D50W 25mL IV push (or per protocol)
- Recheck glucose in 15 minutes
- Identify and address underlying cause

**Life-threatening complications:**
- Loss of consciousness
- Seizures
- Death

### Hyperglycemia
- **Critical:** >500 mg/dL

**Immediate Actions:**
- Assess for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS)
- Check serum ketones and electrolytes
- Initiate insulin therapy per protocol
- IV fluid resuscitation
- Monitor vital signs and mental status

**Life-threatening complications:**
- DKA
- HHS
- Cerebral edema (with rapid correction)

## Hematology

### Hemoglobin
- **Critical Low:** <5.0 g/dL
- **Critical High:** >20.0 g/dL

**Immediate Actions for low values:**
- Type and crossmatch for possible transfusion
- Assess for active bleeding
- Monitor vital signs for hemodynamic instability
- Oxygen therapy as needed

### Platelets
- **Critical Low:** <20,000/mm³

**Immediate Actions:**
- Implement bleeding precautions
- Assess for signs of bleeding (petechiae, ecchymosis, bleeding gums)
- Avoid invasive procedures
- Prepare for possible platelet transfusion
- Hold anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents

**Life-threatening complications:**
- Spontaneous bleeding
- Intracranial hemorrhage

### White Blood Cell Count
- **Critical Low:** <1,000/mm³ (severe neutropenia)
- **Critical High:** >30,000/mm³

**Immediate Actions for neutropenia:**
- Institute neutropenic precautions
- Monitor temperature closely (any fever is emergency)
- Avoid invasive procedures
- Assess for signs of infection

## Arterial Blood Gas (ABG)

### pH
- **Critical Low:** <7.20 (severe acidosis)
- **Critical High:** >7.60 (severe alkalosis)

**Immediate Actions:**
- Assess respiratory status
- Determine metabolic vs. respiratory cause
- Address underlying etiology
- Consider mechanical ventilation for respiratory causes

### PaO₂
- **Critical Low:** <50 mmHg

**Immediate Actions:**
- Apply or increase supplemental oxygen
- Assess respiratory status and work of breathing
- Consider need for advanced airway management

### PaCO₂
- **Critical Low:** <20 mmHg
- **Critical High:** >70 mmHg

**Immediate Actions:**
- For low values: assess for hyperventilation cause
- For high values: assess for respiratory failure, consider ventilatory support

---

## Coagulation Studies

### INR (International Normalized Ratio)
- **Critical High:** >5.0

**Immediate Actions:**
- Assess for active bleeding
- Hold warfarin
- Consider vitamin K administration
- Monitor closely for bleeding

**Critical for procedures:** Patient safety requires specific INR targets before surgery or invasive procedures.

### PTT (Partial Thromboplastin Time)
- **Critical High:** >100 seconds (on heparin therapy)

**Immediate Actions:**
- Hold heparin infusion
- Assess for bleeding
- Consider protamine sulfate if active bleeding

---

## Cardiac Markers

### Troponin
- **Critical:** Elevated above 99th percentile (varies by facility/assay)

**Interpretation:**
- Rising trend indicates acute myocardial injury
- Serial measurements required for diagnosis

**Immediate Actions:**
- Notify physician immediately
- Obtain ECG
- Institute cardiac monitoring
- Initiate acute coronary syndrome protocol

---

## Liver Function

### Ammonia
- **Critical High:** >200 mcg/dL

**Immediate Actions:**
- Assess mental status (hepatic encephalopathy)
- Administer lactulose as ordered
- Protein restriction
- Monitor for increased intracranial pressure

---

## Renal Function

### Creatinine
- **Critical High:** >5.0 mg/dL (or acute rise)

**Immediate Actions:**
- Assess urine output
- Review medications for nephrotoxins
- Check electrolytes (especially potassium)
- Prepare for possible dialysis

### BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)
- **Critical High:** >100 mg/dL

**Immediate Actions:**
- Assess for uremia symptoms
- Monitor fluid and electrolyte status

## Provider Notification Protocol

### When Critical Value is Identified

1. **Immediate notification:** Contact provider immediately (within 15-30 minutes per facility policy)
2. **Documentation:** Record:
   - Critical value and date/time of result
   - Name of provider notified and time
   - Orders received
   - Interventions implemented
3. **Read-back verification:** Have provider read back critical value to ensure accuracy
4. **Follow facility policy:** Adhere to established critical value reporting procedures

### Information to Have Ready

- Patient identification (name, MRN, location)
- Critical value and reference range
- Previous values for comparison
- Relevant clinical information
- Current treatments that may affect value
