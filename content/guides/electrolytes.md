## Sodium (135-145 mEq/L)

### Hyponatremia (<135 mEq/L)

**Clinical Presentation:**
- Altered mental status ranging from confusion to obtundation
- Seizure activity in severe cases
- Generalized muscle weakness and cramping
- Nausea and vomiting
- Headache

**Nursing Interventions:**
- Perform neurological assessments every 2 hours
- Institute seizure precautions for values <120 mEq/L
- Implement fluid restriction as ordered (typically 1-1.5L/day)
- Monitor daily weights and strict intake and output
- Assess for underlying causes (SIADH, diuretic use, excessive water intake)

**Patient Education:**
- Explain importance of limiting free water intake
- Teach patients to read nutrition labels for sodium content
- Instruct patients to report confusion, weakness, or headaches immediately

### Hypernatremia (>145 mEq/L)

**Clinical Presentation:**
- Extreme thirst (polydipsia)
- Dry mucous membranes and poor skin turgor
- Altered mental status
- Restlessness and agitation
- Muscle twitching or spasticity

**Nursing Interventions:**
- Encourage oral fluid intake if patient is able to swallow safely
- Monitor for signs of fluid overload during rehydration
- Assess skin turgor and mucous membranes regularly
- Perform neurological checks every 4 hours
- Monitor urine specific gravity and output

## Potassium (3.5-5.0 mEq/L)

### Hypokalemia (<3.5 mEq/L)

**Clinical Presentation:**
- **Cardiac:** Flattened T waves, prominent U waves, ventricular dysrhythmias
- **Muscular:** Weakness, cramping, potential paralysis
- **Gastrointestinal:** Decreased bowel sounds, paralytic ileus
- **Neurologic:** Confusion, lethargy

**Nursing Interventions:**
- Initiate continuous cardiac monitoring for values <3.0 mEq/L
- Administer IV potassium at maximum rate of 10 mEq/hr via infusion pump only
- Never administer IV potassium as a bolus or push dose
- Monitor IV insertion site closely for infiltration (extravasation causes severe tissue necrosis)
- Track daily weights and maintain strict I&O records
- Review medication list for potassium-wasting diuretics

**Medication Administration:**
- Oral potassium should be taken with food to minimize GI irritation
- Do not crush or break extended-release formulations
- Educate patients to report muscle weakness or palpitations

### Hyperkalemia (>5.0 mEq/L)

**Clinical Presentation (MURDERER mnemonic):**
- **M**uscle weakness
- **U**rine output decreased
- **R**espiratory distress
- **D**ecreased cardiac contractility
- **E**CG changes (peaked T waves, widened QRS complex)
- **R**eflexes decreased or absent
- **E**xcessive GI motility (diarrhea, colic)
- **R**hythm changes (heart block progressing to asystole)

**Emergency Interventions:**
1. Initiate continuous cardiac monitoring immediately
2. Administer calcium gluconate 1-2g IV if ECG changes present (stabilizes cardiac membrane)
3. Give regular insulin with D50 IV to shift potassium intracellularly
4. Administer sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) to remove potassium from the body
5. Prepare for emergency hemodialysis in severe cases

**Medications to Hold:**
- ACE inhibitors and ARBs
- Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride)
- Potassium supplements
- Salt substitutes containing potassium

## Calcium (8.5-10.5 mg/dL)

### Hypocalcemia (<8.5 mg/dL)

**Clinical Presentation:**
- Chvostek's sign (facial muscle twitching when facial nerve tapped)
- Trousseau's sign (carpopedal spasm after BP cuff inflation)
- Perioral numbness and tingling
- Muscle cramps progressing to tetany
- Seizures
- Laryngospasm (life-threatening)

**Nursing Interventions:**
- Keep calcium gluconate 1-2g IV at bedside for emergency administration
- Institute seizure precautions
- Monitor for signs of respiratory distress or laryngospasm
- Check serum albumin levels (hypoalbuminemia causes falsely low total calcium)
- Consider ionized calcium measurement for more accurate assessment

**Clinical Note:** Always check albumin levels when interpreting calcium results. For every 1 g/dL decrease in albumin below 4 g/dL, add 0.8 mg/dL to the total calcium to estimate the corrected calcium level.

### Hypercalcemia (>10.5 mg/dL)

**Clinical Presentation:**
Classic mnemonic: "Stones, bones, groans, psychiatric overtones"
- Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis)
- Bone pain and pathologic fractures
- Constipation, nausea, anorexia
- Confusion, depression, personality changes

**Nursing Interventions:**
- Encourage oral fluid intake of 3-4L/day unless contraindicated
- Monitor for symptoms of nephrolithiasis
- Promote mobility and weight-bearing activity
- Implement dietary modifications (low calcium intake)
- Administer loop diuretics as ordered to promote calcium excretion

## Magnesium (1.5-2.5 mEq/L)

### Hypomagnesemia (<1.5 mEq/L)

**Clinical Presentation:**
- Similar presentation to hypocalcemia
- Positive Chvostek's and Trousseau's signs
- Concurrent hypokalemia and hypocalcemia (often refractory to treatment)
- Seizures and cardiac dysrhythmias

**Important:** Magnesium deficiency must be corrected before potassium and calcium levels will normalize. Magnesium is required for proper function of the sodium-potassium-ATPase pump.

**Nursing Interventions:**
- Administer IV magnesium sulfate slowly to prevent respiratory depression
- Monitor deep tendon reflexes during IV administration (absence indicates toxicity)
- Assess for concurrent electrolyte imbalances
- Keep calcium gluconate available as antidote for magnesium toxicity

### Hypermagnesemia (>2.5 mEq/L)

**Clinical Presentation:**
- Decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes (first sign)
- Respiratory depression
- Hypotension
- Bradycardia
- Complete heart block in severe cases

**Emergency Management:**
- Keep calcium gluconate 1-2g IV available (antidote)
- Monitor respiratory status continuously
- Assess deep tendon reflexes frequently
- Prepare for ventilatory support if needed
- Consider hemodialysis for severe cases

## Clinical Priorities

### Assessment Focus by Electrolyte

**Monitor cardiac status closely for:**
- Potassium imbalances (most immediately life-threatening)
- Calcium imbalances
- Magnesium imbalances

**Monitor neurologic status closely for:**
- Sodium imbalances (cerebral edema or dehydration)
- Calcium imbalances (seizure risk)
- Magnesium imbalances

**Monitor respiratory status closely for:**
- Magnesium toxicity (respiratory depression)
- Severe hypocalcemia (laryngospasm)

### Documentation Requirements

Complete nursing documentation must include:
- Serial vital signs with cardiac rhythm analysis
- Detailed neurologic assessment findings
- Accurate intake and output measurements
- Daily weight trends
- Patient response to interventions
- Any adverse reactions to treatment

### NCLEX Preparation

**Key concepts to remember:**
- **Potassium:** Cardiac effects are most critical - always monitor ECG
- **Sodium:** Neurologic effects dominate - monitor mental status closely
- **Calcium:** Affects neuromuscular function - watch for tetany and seizures
- **Magnesium:** Often called "the forgotten electrolyte" - check it when K+ or Ca²⁺ won't correct
