## Standard Precautions

### Fundamental Principles

Standard precautions are the minimum infection prevention practices that apply to all patient care, regardless of suspected or confirmed infection status. These practices are based on the principle that all blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions (except sweat), non-intact skin, and mucous membranes may contain transmissible infectious agents.

### Hand Hygiene

**When to perform hand hygiene:**
- Before and after every patient contact
- Before putting on gloves
- Immediately after glove removal
- Before performing aseptic procedures
- After contact with patient environment
- After contact with body fluids or contaminated surfaces

**Method:**
- **Alcohol-based hand rub:** Preferred method when hands are not visibly soiled
- **Soap and water:** Required when hands are visibly soiled, after using restroom, and for C. difficile exposure

### PPE Selection

**Gloves:**
- Wear when contact with body fluids, mucous membranes, non-intact skin, or contaminated items
- Change between procedures on same patient if contacting different body sites
- Remove and perform hand hygiene before touching environment

**Gowns:**
- Wear when clothing may become contaminated with body fluids
- Select appropriate size and material for procedure

**Masks, Eye Protection, Face Shields:**
- Wear when splash, spray, or spatter of body fluids anticipated
- Protect mucous membranes of eyes, nose, and mouth

### Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette

- Cover nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing
- Use tissues and dispose in no-touch receptacle
- Perform hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions
- Offer masks to coughing patients

## Contact Precautions

### Purpose

Prevent transmission of infectious agents spread by direct or indirect contact with patient or patient environment.

### Room Requirements

- **Private room preferred** or cohort patients with same organism
- **Dedicated equipment** when possible (stethoscope, blood pressure cuff, thermometer)
- **Door signage:** Clear identification of precaution type
- **Door may remain open**

### PPE Requirements

**Gown:**
- Put on before entering patient room
- Remove before leaving room
- Ensure gown covers torso from neck to knees and wraps to cover back
- Secure at neck and waist

**Gloves:**
- Put on after donning gown
- Use non-sterile gloves unless performing sterile procedure
- Change if hands will move from contaminated site to clean site on same patient
- Remove before leaving room

### Donning Sequence
1. Gown
2. Mask or Respirator (if needed)
3. Goggles or Face Shield (if needed)
4. Gloves

### Doffing Sequence
1. Gloves
2. Goggles or Face Shield
3. Gown
4. Mask or Respirator
5. Perform hand hygiene

### Common Organisms Requiring Contact Precautions

- **MRSA** (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus)
- **VRE** (Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus)
- **C. difficile** (Clostridioides difficile) - requires soap and water hand hygiene
- **Scabies**
- **Impetigo**
- **Pediculosis** (lice)
- **Multidrug-resistant organisms**
- **Viral hemorrhagic fevers**

### Duration

Continue until patient cultures negative per facility protocol or for duration of symptoms.

## Droplet Precautions

### Purpose

Prevent transmission of pathogens spread through respiratory or mucous membrane contact with respiratory droplets generated by coughing, sneezing, or talking.

### Transmission Characteristics

- Droplets travel approximately 3-6 feet from source
- Too large to remain airborne (fall to ground quickly)
- Do not require special air handling

### Room Requirements

- **Private room preferred** or cohort with same organism
- **Door may remain open**
- **Spatial separation:** Maintain at least 3 feet between patients
- **Standard air handling** (no negative pressure required)

### PPE Requirements

**Surgical Mask:**
- Put on before entering patient room within 3 feet
- Remove after leaving patient room and closing door
- Secure ties or elastic bands at middle of head and neck
- Fit flexible band to nose bridge
- Fit snug to face and below chin

**Additional PPE:**
- Gown and gloves if contact with patient or contaminated surfaces anticipated

### Patient Transport

- **Limit transport** to medically necessary purposes only
- **Surgical mask on patient** during transport
- **Notify receiving area** of precaution status

### Common Illnesses Requiring Droplet Precautions

- **Influenza**
- **RSV** (Respiratory Syncytial Virus)
- **Pertussis** (Whooping Cough)
- **Mumps**
- **Rubella**
- **Adenovirus**
- **Invasive Neisseria meningitidis** (meningococcal disease)
- **Invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b**

### Duration

Continue for duration specified by pathogen-specific recommendations (typically duration of illness or until 24-48 hours after initiation of effective therapy).

---

## Airborne Precautions

### Purpose

Prevent transmission of infectious agents that remain infectious over long distances when suspended in air.

### Transmission Characteristics

- Particles <5 microns can remain suspended in air
- Travel on air currents over long distances
- Require special air handling and respiratory protection

### Room Requirements

**Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR):**
- **Negative pressure room** (≥12 air changes per hour for new construction)
- **Direct exhaust** to outside or HEPA filtration if recirculated
- **Door must remain closed** except for entry/exit
- **Pressure monitoring** to verify negative pressure maintained

**If AIIR not available:**
- Transfer patient to facility with AIIR
- Until transfer, place surgical mask on patient
- Separate patient from others

### PPE Requirements

**N95 Respirator or PAPR:**
- Required for all who enter room
- Must be fit-tested annually and pass seal check each use
- Put on before entering room
- Remove after leaving room and closing door

**Surgical mask on patient** during transport

### Fit Testing and Seal Check

**Annual fit testing required** for N95 respirators

**User seal check before each use:**
1. Cup respirator in hands
2. Inhale sharply - respirator should collapse slightly
3. Exhale - check for air leakage around edges

### Common Illnesses Requiring Airborne Precautions

- **Tuberculosis** (pulmonary or laryngeal, suspected or confirmed)
- **Measles** (Rubeola)
- **Varicella** (Chickenpox) - disseminated or immunocompromised
- **Herpes Zoster** (Shingles) - disseminated or immunocompromised

### Duration

- **TB:** Until patient has received adequate therapy and has three negative sputum smears
- **Measles:** Duration of illness
- **Varicella:** Until lesions are crusted

### Healthcare Worker Immunity

- Workers with documented immunity to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella may not need N95 for those specific infections
- Still required for TB

## Enhanced Precautions for Novel or Emerging Pathogens

When novel respiratory pathogens emerge (e.g., COVID-19, SARS, MERS), facilities may implement enhanced precautions combining elements of contact, droplet, and/or airborne precautions based on CDC guidance and knowledge of transmission characteristics.

---

## Patient and Visitor Education

### Key Points to Communicate

- Reason for isolation precautions
- Required PPE and proper use
- Hand hygiene importance and technique
- Restrictions on movement outside room
- Duration of precautions

### Psychological Considerations

- Patients on isolation may experience:
  - Anxiety and depression
  - Feelings of isolation and loneliness
  - Reduced staff interaction time
- Interventions:
  - Frequent check-ins
  - Communication via phone or video when appropriate
  - Psychological support services

---

## Discontinuation of Precautions

### Criteria Vary by Pathogen

- Negative culture results (per facility protocol)
- Completion of antimicrobial therapy course
- Resolution of symptoms
- Time-based criteria for specific pathogens

### Documentation

- Provider order required to discontinue
- Documentation in medical record
- Notification to all healthcare team members
- Removal of signage
