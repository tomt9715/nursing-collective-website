## Essential Formulas

### Basic Dosage Formula
```
Desired Dose
------------ × Quantity = Amount to Administer
Dose on Hand
```

### Dimensional Analysis
```
Known Value × Conversion Factor = Unknown Value
```

### Ratio and Proportion
```
Known Ratio :: Unknown Ratio
or
Known : Known = Unknown : Unknown
```

## Basic Dosage Calculations

### Example 1: Oral Tablets

**Order:** Furosemide 80 mg PO
**Available:** Furosemide 40 mg tablets
**Calculate:** How many tablets should be administered?

**Solution:**
```
80 mg (desired)
--------------- × 1 tablet = 2 tablets
40 mg (on hand)
```

### Example 2: Liquid Oral Medications

**Order:** Amoxicillin 500 mg PO
**Available:** Amoxicillin suspension 250 mg/5 mL
**Calculate:** How many mL should be administered?

**Solution:**
```
500 mg     5 mL
------ × ------- = 10 mL
  1      250 mg
```

### Practice Problem

## IV Flow Rate Calculations

### mL/hr Calculation
```
Total Volume (mL)
----------------- = mL/hr
Total Time (hours)
```

### Example 1: Basic IV Infusion

**Order:** 1000 mL normal saline over 8 hours
**Calculate:** mL/hr rate for infusion pump

**Solution:**
```
1000 mL
------- = 125 mL/hr
8 hours
```

### Example 2: Drops per Minute (Manual Regulation)

**Order:** 1000 mL over 8 hours
**Drop Factor:** 15 gtts/mL
**Calculate:** Drops per minute

**Formula:**
```
Total Volume (mL) × Drop Factor (gtts/mL)
--------------------------------------- = gtts/min
Total Time (minutes)
```

**Solution:**
```
1000 mL × 15 gtts/mL
------------------- = 31 gtts/min (round to 31)
480 minutes
```

### Drop Factor Quick Reference

- **Macrodrip tubing:** 10, 15, or 20 gtts/mL
- **Microdrip tubing:** 60 gtts/mL
- **Important shortcut:** With 60 gtts/mL tubing, gtts/min = mL/hr

## Weight-Based Dosing

### mg/kg Calculation Formula
```
Patient Weight (kg) × Ordered Dose (mg/kg) = Total Dose (mg)
```

### Example 1: Pediatric Dosing

**Patient:** 25 kg child
**Order:** Amoxicillin 25 mg/kg/day divided TID (three times daily)
**Calculate:** mg per dose

**Solution:**
```
Step 1: Calculate total daily dose
25 kg × 25 mg/kg = 625 mg/day

Step 2: Divide by number of doses
625 mg ÷ 3 doses = 208 mg per dose
```

### Example 2: Weight-Based Continuous Infusion

**Patient:** 70 kg adult
**Order:** Dopamine 5 mcg/kg/min
**Calculate:** mcg/min

**Solution:**
```
70 kg × 5 mcg/kg/min = 350 mcg/min
```

### Converting Pounds to Kilograms
```
Weight in pounds ÷ 2.2 = Weight in kg
```

**Example:** 154 lbs ÷ 2.2 = 70 kg

---

## Concentration Calculations

### mg/mL from Percentage Solution
```
Percentage × 10 = mg/mL
```

**Examples:**
- 1% lidocaine = 10 mg/mL
- 0.9% normal saline = 9 mg/mL sodium chloride
- 2% lidocaine = 20 mg/mL

### Ratio Strength Conversions

**Example:** Epinephrine 1:1000

This means 1 gram in 1000 mL
- Convert to mg: 1 gram = 1000 mg
- Calculate concentration: 1000 mg ÷ 1000 mL = 1 mg/mL

**Example:** Epinephrine 1:10,000 = 0.1 mg/mL

---

## IV Medication Calculations

### Concentration Formula
```
Amount of Drug (mg)
------------------ = Concentration (mg/mL)
Total Volume (mL)
```

### Example 1: IV Push Medication

**Order:** Furosemide 40 mg IV push
**Available:** 100 mg/10 mL vial
**Calculate:** mL to withdraw

**Solution:**
```
40 mg     10 mL
----- × ------- = 4 mL
 1      100 mg
```

### Example 2: Continuous IV Infusion with Titration

**Order:** Dopamine 400 mg in 250 mL D5W at 350 mcg/min
**Calculate:** mL/hr rate

**Solution:**

Step 1: Determine concentration in mcg/mL
```
400 mg = 400,000 mcg
400,000 mcg ÷ 250 mL = 1600 mcg/mL
```

Step 2: Calculate infusion rate
```
350 mcg/min × 60 min/hr   21,000 mcg/hr
----------------------- = ------------- = 13.1 mL/hr
1600 mcg/mL                1600 mcg/mL
```

## Complex Calculations

### Alligation Method (Mixing Solutions)

**Used when mixing different concentrations to achieve desired strength.**

**Problem:** Mix 10% and 2% solutions to make 500 mL of 5% solution

**Method:**
```
Higher concentration (10%)  ← Difference from desired (5-2=3 parts)

Desired concentration (5%)

Lower concentration (2%)    ← Difference from desired (10-5=5 parts)
```

**Solution:**
- Ratio is 3:5 (total 8 parts)
- 10% solution needed: (3/8) × 500 mL = 187.5 mL
- 2% solution needed: (5/8) × 500 mL = 312.5 mL

### Dilution Formula

**When diluting a solution to weaker strength:**
```
(Concentration Available) × (Volume Available) = (Concentration Desired) × (Volume Desired)

or: C₁V₁ = C₂V₂
```

## Common Clinical Calculations

### Insulin Drip Calculations

**Protocol:** Regular insulin infusion
**Patient weight:** 80 kg
**Current rate:** 5 units/hr
**Calculate:** units/kg/hr

**Solution:**
```
5 units/hr
---------- = 0.0625 units/kg/hr
80 kg
```

### Heparin Protocol Dosing

**Protocol:** 18 units/kg/hr
**Patient weight:** 70 kg
**Calculate:** Infusion rate in units/hr

**Solution:**
```
70 kg × 18 units/kg/hr = 1260 units/hr
```

**If concentration is 25,000 units in 250 mL:**
```
1260 units/hr     250 mL
------------- × ------------ = 12.6 mL/hr
     1          25,000 units
```

### Body Surface Area (BSA) Calculations

**Used primarily for chemotherapy dosing:**
```
BSA (m²) = √[(Height in cm × Weight in kg) ÷ 3600]
```

**Alternative formula (Mosteller):**
```
BSA (m²) = √[(Height in cm × Weight in kg) ÷ 3600]
```

## High-Alert Medications

### Require Independent Double-Check

- Insulin (all routes and formulations)
- Heparin and low molecular weight heparins
- Chemotherapy agents
- Pediatric and neonatal medications
- Vasoactive infusions (dopamine, norepinephrine, etc.)

### Safety Guidelines

1. Have another qualified nurse independently verify calculations
2. Use calculator for complex calculations
3. Know expected dose ranges for medications
4. Question any dose that seems unusually high or low
5. Utilize pharmacy and drug reference resources
6. Never skip the verification step to save time

## Calculation Shortcuts

### Mental Math Tips

- **Percentage to mg/mL:** Multiply percentage by 10
- **Pounds to kg:** Divide by 2.2 (or multiply by 0.45 for estimation)
- **Microdrip:** Drops/min = mL/hr when using 60 gtts/mL tubing

### Common Conversions

**Volume:**
- 1 teaspoon = 5 mL
- 1 tablespoon = 15 mL
- 1 fluid ounce = 30 mL
- 1 cup = 240 mL

**Weight:**
- 1 kg = 2.2 pounds
- 1 gram = 1000 mg
- 1 mg = 1000 mcg
