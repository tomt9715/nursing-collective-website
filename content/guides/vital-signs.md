## Heart Rate Assessment

### Normal Variations

**Physiologic factors affecting heart rate:**
- Athletes may have resting rates of 40-60 bpm due to increased cardiac efficiency
- Maximum heart rate decreases with age (estimated by 220 - patient's age)
- Fever typically increases heart rate by approximately 10 bpm per 1°F rise in temperature
- Pain, anxiety, and stress increase heart rate through sympathetic nervous system activation

### Assessment Technique

**Standard procedure:**
1. Palpate radial pulse for routine assessment in conscious, stable patients
2. Auscultate apical pulse for accuracy when rhythm is irregular or in pediatric patients
3. Count for full 60 seconds if rhythm is irregular
4. Assess and document rhythm quality (regular vs. irregular), strength, and equality bilaterally

**Pulse deficit assessment:**
- Simultaneously measure apical and radial pulses (requires two clinicians)
- Calculate difference between apical and radial rates
- Pulse deficit indicates ineffective cardiac contractions reaching periphery

### When to Notify Provider

Contact physician for:
- New onset irregular rhythm
- Heart rate <50 or >120 bpm in adults without known cause
- Accompanying symptoms: chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, syncope
- Significant pulse deficit

## Respiratory Rate Assessment

### Assessment Technique

**Proper measurement:**
1. Do not inform patient you are counting respirations (awareness alters breathing pattern)
2. Count respirations immediately after taking pulse while appearing to still assess pulse
3. Count for 30 seconds and multiply by two for regular respirations
4. Count for full 60 seconds if rate is irregular or abnormal
5. Observe chest rise and fall, noting depth, rhythm, and effort

### Respiratory Patterns

**Common abnormal patterns:**
- **Tachypnea:** Rate >20/min in adults; often indicates respiratory distress or compensation
- **Bradypnea:** Rate <12/min in adults; may indicate CNS depression or medication effect
- **Apnea:** Cessation of breathing >15 seconds
- **Cheyne-Stokes:** Gradual increase in depth and rate, then gradual decrease, followed by apnea period; seen in heart failure and brain injury

### Signs of Respiratory Distress

**Critical assessment findings:**
- Use of accessory muscles (sternocleidomastoid, intercostal)
- Nasal flaring, particularly significant in pediatric patients
- Retractions (intercostal, substernal, supraclavicular)
- Central cyanosis (circumoral, trunk)
- Tripod positioning
- Inability to speak in complete sentences

## Blood Pressure Assessment

### Classification (Adults - ACC/AHA Guidelines)

- **Normal:** <120/80 mmHg
- **Elevated:** Systolic 120-129 and diastolic <80 mmHg
- **Stage 1 Hypertension:** Systolic 130-139 or diastolic 80-89 mmHg
- **Stage 2 Hypertension:** Systolic ≥140 or diastolic ≥90 mmHg
- **Hypertensive Crisis:** Systolic >180 and/or diastolic >120 mmHg

### Proper Measurement Technique

**Essential components for accuracy:**
1. Patient should be seated quietly for 5 minutes before measurement
2. Feet flat on floor, back supported, arm at heart level
3. Use appropriate cuff size (bladder should cover 80% of arm circumference)
4. Place cuff on bare skin (not over clothing)
5. Patient should avoid talking during measurement
6. Obtain at least two readings, 1-2 minutes apart, and average the results

**Common errors causing false readings:**
- Cuff too small: falsely elevates reading
- Arm below heart level: falsely elevates reading
- Arm above heart level: falsely decreases reading
- Recent caffeine, nicotine, or exercise: elevates reading

### Orthostatic Hypotension Assessment

**Screening procedure:**
1. Measure blood pressure and heart rate after patient supine for 5 minutes
2. Have patient stand (or sit if unable to stand)
3. Measure blood pressure and heart rate within 1-3 minutes of position change

**Positive findings:**
- Systolic BP decrease ≥20 mmHg or diastolic BP decrease ≥10 mmHg
- Symptoms: dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, visual changes
- Indicates hypovolemia, autonomic dysfunction, or medication effect

### Pediatric Considerations

**Important factors:**
- Use age-appropriate cuff size (inadequate size most common error)
- Normal values vary significantly by age, sex, and height percentile
- Consider anxiety effect ("white coat hypertension") - may need multiple readings
- Repeat elevated readings on subsequent visits before diagnosing hypertension

## Temperature Assessment

### Routes and Accuracy

**Comparison of methods:**
1. **Rectal:** Most accurate core temperature; typically 0.5-1.0°F higher than oral
2. **Oral:** Standard for conscious, cooperative adults; affected by recent intake
3. **Axillary:** Least accurate; typically 1.0°F lower than oral; useful when other routes contraindicated
4. **Tympanic:** Quick but accuracy depends on proper technique and cerumen presence
5. **Temporal artery:** Non-invasive, suitable for all ages, accurate when performed correctly

### Fever Classification

**Temperature ranges:**
- **Low-grade fever:** 100.0-100.4°F (37.8-38°C)
- **Moderate fever:** 100.5-102.4°F (38.1-39.1°C)
- **High fever:** 102.5-104.0°F (39.2-40°C)
- **Hyperpyrexia:** >104.0°F (>40°C)

### Treatment Guidelines

**When to treat fever:**
- Adults: Generally treat at >101°F (38.3°C) if patient experiencing discomfort
- Pediatrics: Any fever ≥100.4°F (38°C) in infants <3 months requires immediate evaluation
- Immunocompromised patients: Fever ≥100.4°F (38°C) requires prompt assessment
- Cardiac patients: Consider treatment at lower thresholds due to increased metabolic demands

### Hypothermia Classification

**Severity levels:**
- **Mild:** 90-95°F (32-35°C)
- **Moderate:** 82-90°F (28-32°C)
- **Severe:** <82°F (<28°C)

**Clinical presentation progresses from shivering and confusion to loss of consciousness and cardiac arrest as core temperature decreases.**

## Oxygen Saturation (SpO₂)

### Normal Values and Targets

- **Healthy individuals:** 95-100%
- **COPD patients:** Target 88-92% (higher levels may suppress respiratory drive)
- **Patients with chronic conditions:** May have lower baseline; compare to patient's normal

### Assessment Considerations

**Factors affecting accuracy:**
1. Remove nail polish before applying finger probe
2. Ensure adequate perfusion to probe site (warm, well-perfused)
3. Minimize motion artifact during measurement
4. Wait for consistent waveform before recording value
5. Consider hemoglobin level (anemia affects oxygen-carrying capacity)

**Limitations:**
- Carbon monoxide poisoning produces falsely normal readings
- Severe anemia may not reflect true oxygenation status
- Dark nail polish (particularly blue, green, black) interferes with reading
- Poor peripheral circulation gives inaccurate or no reading

### Critical Actions

**Immediate interventions needed:**
- **SpO₂ <90%:** Requires immediate intervention and assessment
- **SpO₂ <85%:** Medical emergency; prepare for supplemental oxygen and rapid response
- **Trending downward:** May indicate developing respiratory distress before other symptoms appear

---

## Clinical Priorities

### Emergency Assessment Sequence

**Follow ABC priority:**
1. **Airway and Breathing:** Assess respiratory rate, effort, and oxygen saturation first
2. **Circulation:** Assess heart rate, blood pressure, and peripheral perfusion
3. **Level of consciousness:** Assess mental status concurrently with vital signs

### Documentation Requirements

**Complete vital sign documentation includes:**
- All measured values with date and time
- Patient position during blood pressure measurement
- Route used for temperature (oral, rectal, axillary, temporal, tympanic)
- Any symptoms accompanying abnormal vital signs
- Interventions provided and patient response
- Trend comparison with previous measurements

### Age-Specific Considerations

**Pediatric population:**
- Use age-appropriate equipment (correct cuff size, pediatric stethoscope)
- Employ distraction techniques to obtain accurate measurements
- Allow parent presence for comfort and cooperation
- Obtain multiple readings if child is upset or crying
- Compare values to age-appropriate norms, not adult ranges

**Geriatric population:**
- Allow more time for position changes (prevent orthostatic hypotension)
- Consider medication effects (antihypertensives, beta-blockers)
- Recognize that baseline vital signs may differ from young adult norms
- Assess for atypical presentations of illness (fever may be blunted)
- Ensure clear communication about symptoms
